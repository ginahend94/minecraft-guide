                    Minecraft is a wildly popular video game. New users are trying it out every day. If you happen to
                    find
                    yourself as one of these Minecraft newcomers, and you're looking for where to start, you've come to
                    a
                    reasonably adequate place!

                    My name is Gina, and I'm a fully-grown adult woman who plays Minecraft for hours at a time.<br />
                    Now that we've gotten the introductions out of the way, you may be asking what makes me qualified to
                    write up a guide to Minecraft. The answer, my friends, is absolutely nothing. However, I do have my
                    own
                    experiences from when I was new player &#40;about seven years ago&#41;. Back then, I had a tendency
                    to
                    overthink <em>everything</em> in-game &#40;and out-of-game&#41;. It took me way too long to beat the
                    game &#40;yeah, you can <em>beat Minecraft</em>&#41;. Now, I hope to pass on the basics I discovered
                    along the way. So go ahead and scroll down to get started<span id="desktop">, or click on one of the
                        tabs to jump to a section</span>!

                    <figcaption>you'll be playing soon</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Before you're able to play Minecraft, you'll have to <a
                        href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft" target="_blank">buy the game</a>. Once
                    you've
                    made your purchase, download the game and run the installer &#40;which should walk you through
                    installation step-by-step&#41;.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now that you've got it installed, you're ready to start up Minecraft for the first time! Open the
                    Minecraft launcher, log in, and make sure "Latest release" is selected as the version. Two benefits
                    of
                    Minecraft are access to all previous versions of the game and the use of mods, but for now, we'll
                    just
                    start with the most recent Vanilla (unmodded) version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that the game has loaded, you'll want to select "Single Player" and create a new world. There
                    are
                    three game modes available on the world-creation screen:<br /><br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Survival Mode - this mode is the basic mode of the game. No cheats (unless you enable them),
                        hunger,
                        and the ability to die and respawn.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creative Mode - this mode gives you unlimited access to cheats, the creative menu, and flight.
                        You
                        cannot die in this mode (unless you fall into the void). Great for building and experimenting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hardcore Mode - this mode is the most difficult and notorious. The game is locked into Hard
                        difficulty, which means enemies are stronger and more dangerous. You can also die from hunger in
                        this difficulty. The most significant part of Hardcore mode is the fact that you only have one
                        life&#8212; if you die, you do not respawn. You can either spectate the world or delete it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                For this guide, we will be using Survival mode set to Normal difficulty.

                    <h2>Your First Night<h2>
                </header>
                <div>
                    <h3>
                        Basic controls
                    </h3>
                    Now that you've loaded into the game, you can start playing. Move around with <code>W</code>,
                    <code>A</code>, <code>S</code>, and <code>D</code>, and use <code>space</code> to jump. You can use
                    <code>right-click</code> to interact with items and use what you have in your off-hand.
                </div>
                <h3>Your User Interface</h3>
                <p>
                    The User Interface (UI) includes some key features:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Your health and hunger bars (bottom right of the screen). They should be completely full upon
                        starting a new game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your hotbar (bottom middle of screen). This is where you can quickly access nine inventory items
                        and
                        hold them in your hand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your inventory screen. The inventory key is usually set to <code>E</code> upon starting the game
                        for
                        the first time. This screen has a small 2 x 2 crafting grid, 27 inventory slots, a view of your
                        character, and slots to place armor and an offhand item (such as a shield).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've familiarized yourself with the UI, take a look around at your surroundings. The region
                    in
                    which you've spawned is referred to as a <em>biome</em>. There are different flora, fauna, and
                    structures in differing biomes. Most biomes, however, contain one of the most vital and basic
                    features
                    of Minecraft: trees.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h3>
                        Crafting tools
                    </h3>
                    <figure id="pickaxe">

                    </figure>
                    You may have heard the phrase "punching trees" before. This is apt, because in order to collect
                    wood,
                    you'll need to "punch" whatever trees you see around you. To punch, use <code>left-click</code>.
                    Items
                    are automatically added to your inventory when you walk near them. Then, you can place the wood into
                    your crafting grid to create four wooden planks. Put these planks back into the crafting grid (one
                    in
                    each slot) and you've just made a crafting table! This tool will allow you to craft so much more
                    than
                    your small crafting grid.
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now that you've got a crafting table, you can make some rudimentary wooden tools. However, I
                    recommend
                    making only a pickaxe. You can use the wooden pickaxe to mine enough cobblestone for a stone
                    pickaxe,
                    which is much more efficient and durable. You can get cobblestone from stone in caves or just in the
                    ground under dirt. You should also use this stone to craft a stone sword, axe, shovel, and furnace.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>
                    Your first base
                </h3>
                It's important to remember that hostile mobs come out once the sun sets. These include zombies,
                skeletons,
                creepers, spiders, and more. You can try to fight these mobs your first night, but it can get very
                overwhelming very quickly. My recommendation is to craft a bed to skip the night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to craft a bed, you'll need three pieces of wool in the same color, as well as three wooden
                    planks. You can obtain wool from sheep. Shearing sheep can drop 1-3 pieces of wool, but if you don't
                    have shears yet, you'll have to kill the sheep. Killed sheep only drop one wool each.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way to obtain a bed is to take one from a village. All villages have beds in the villager
                    houses, which is convenient if you spawn in near one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll want to make a small shelter before the sun goes down to protect yourself, especially if you
                    don't have a bed yet. A wooden box is typically enough, along with a door and some torches. A chest
                    to
                    store items will be useful as well. Get your shelter built, and settle in for the night.

                    </h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Congratulations, you've survived your first night! Now you'll want to get some resources for
                    crafting.
                    The most reliable way to gather resources is mining, although caving can sometimes be faster. The
                    basic
                    resources you'll want to collect include iron, for making iron tools and armor, and coal, to smelt
                    your
                    ores and cook food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mining can be as simple or complex as you like. The simplest mines are staircase-style. Just dig
                    down
                    and forward, but <strong>never dig straight down</strong>. Doing this can result in falling a great
                    distance into a cave or dropping down into lava.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you've gotten some iron and coal, head back to your base to smelt it in a furnace. Use the
                    resulting iron ingots to craft yourself some armor, a shield, and a bucket for carrying water.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>diamonds!!</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    While you're mining, you may come across other ores, such as copper, gold, redstone, lapis lazuli,
                    emeralds, or (hopefully) diamonds. Be cautious; gold, redstone, emerald and diamond ores must be
                    mined
                    with an iron pickaxe or better, or else they drop nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another resource you'll definitely need is food. You can get raw meat from cows, pigs, chickens,
                    sheep,
                    goats, and rabbits. You can also get fish by either using a fishing rod or scooping one out of the
                    water
                    with a bucket. Bread can be crafted from three pieces of wheat. There are many other foods to
                    discover
                    as you play the game. Cooked food gives more health and saturation than raw food.

                    Now that you've got some food and armor, you're ready to enter the Nether. To get there, you'll need
                    to
                    create a 5-high x 4-wide hollow rectangle of obsidian. Light the center of the Nether portal with a
                    flint and steel and watch it fill with a purple portal substance. Step inside to be transported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Nether is a hot dimension. How hot? Well, water instantly evaporates when placed. Look out for
                    the
                    mobs that inhabit this area, like ghasts (which shoot dangerous fireballs), piglins (hostile
                    pig-people,
                    unless you're wearing gold), and zombified piglins (the piglin's <em>extremely</em> strong zombie
                    counterpart. They willl ignore you unless you hit one of them, but <strong>do not hit one of
                        them</strong>, even accidentally. The entire horde will turn on you). There are many other mobs,
                    in
                    the Nether, so keep your eyes peeled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your first step in the Nether is to check your coordinates (<code>F3</code>). It is very easy to
                    lose
                    track of your portal home. It's also a good idea to keep an eye out for any landmarks while you
                    explore.
                    This will help you find your way back more easily without having to constantly check your
                    coordinates.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>zombified piglin</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The next thing that you'll want to do is begin searching for a Nether fortress. These large brick
                    structures contain blaze spawners, as well as some loot. Blazes are needed for their rods, which you
                    can
                    use to craft eyes of ender (necessary for beating the game). These mobs are dangerous, shooting
                    fireballs and dealing melee damage. It's useful to have a shield while fighting them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you have your blaze rods, you can choose to either leave the Nether to obtain ender pearls (the
                    other ingredient for eyes of ender), or&#8212; if you have gold ingots&#8212; barter with piglins,
                    who
                    have a chance of giving ender pearls in a trade.

                    <h2>
                        Getting to the End
                    </h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The End is the third and final dimension in Minecraft (for now). This is where you will fight the
                    Ender
                    dragon. Getting there is a bit of an involved process. The first thing you will need to do is get at
                    least twelve ender pearls. You can these from either bartering with piglins (explained above),
                    trading
                    with cleric villagers, or killing endermen. It's really your choice how you want to get the ender
                    pearls, but one of the easiest ways is villager trading. Here's a quick guide:
                <ol>
                    <li>Find a village</li>
                    <li>Find the fletcher villager (you can "make" a fletcher by crafting a fletching table and putting
                        it
                        near an unemployed villager)</li>
                    <li>Trade sticks to amass a large amount of emeralds</li>
                    <li>Either find the existing brewing stand in the church or craft one</li>
                    <li>Get a cleric villager</li>
                    <li>Trade with the cleric over and over until they reach expert level (there is unfortunately a
                        &#8531;
                        chance the ender pearl trade will not appear, in which case you'll have to start again with a
                        new
                        cleric)
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you have your twelve ender pearls, craft them with blaze powder (obtained from blaze rods in a
                    crafting grid) to get eyes of ender. Throwing an eye of ender will point you in the direction of the
                    stronghold, where the end portal is. The trip may take a while, but be patient and keep following
                    the
                    eye of ender. Once it goes downward into the ground, start digging (carefully!) until you reach
                    stone
                    bricks. You've made it!
                </p>

                    <figcaption>an eye of ender</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                <h3>Finding the portal</h3>
                The stronghold is a maze-like structure that is filled with hostile mobs, loot, and strange rooms. Keep
                your
                eyes open as you traverse each room. When you find the portal room, it's useful to set your spawn with a
                bed
                in case you die fighting the dragon. If the stronghold is very far from your base, you'll have to repeat
                the
                journey every time you die.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The portal will have twelve slots for eyes of ender. Place an eye in each spot, and the portal will
                    activate. Be sure before you enter, however, because once inside, you cannot leave the End until you
                    either die or defeat the dragon. When you feel ready to face the dragon, jump inside the portal.

                    <h2>
                        Defeating the Dragon
                    </h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    There are two main parts to the dragon fight: destroying the end crystals and killing the dragon
                    herself. You'll also have to avoid aggroing the endermen that live there in the end. They become
                    hostile
                    when you make eye contact with them or attack them. As long as you avoid doing that, the dragon will
                    be
                    your main focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Destroying the end crystals</h3>
                The end crystals are located atop the giant obsidian towers that are on the main end island. They are
                explosive and very dangerous, so your best bet to breaking them is shooting them with an bow and arrow.
                Barring that, you can also tower up to them and break them with your fist, but the resulting explosion
                will
                be very powerful. Take your time and make sure you destroy every crystal, because the dragon uses them
                to
                regenerate her health. If you break a crystal while she's drawing health from it, it damages her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once all the crystals have been destroyed, it's time to take on the dragon herself. You can go about
                    this multiple ways: shooting her with arrows, using bed explosions, and melee. We'll be going over
                    the
                    final tactic.

                    <figcaption>the ender dragon</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                <h3>Killing the dragon</h3>
                The dragon attacks in three ways. She breathes harmful dragon breath, charges you, and throws you,
                possibly
                to your death. In the course of the dragon's flight, she will periodically perch down on the bedrock
                platform in the center of the island. When she's there, you can attack her head with your sword. Do this
                as
                many times as necessary, and you can kill the dragon. It's that simple!
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>After the fight</h3>
                When the dragon is dead, three things happen: XP orbs will rain down, the main portal will open up, and
                an
                end gateway will appear. If you like, you can go through the end gateway using an ender pearl and
                explore
                the rest of the End. There you can find end cities, which contain loot, and end ships, which have
                elytras in
                addition to the loot chests found there. Elytras are extremely useful, as they allow you to glide
                through
                the air and, with the use of firework rockets, fly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you go through the main portal, the end poem will be displayed, followed by the game credits.
                    Afterwards, you will be teleported back to your bed or (if you have no bed) to spawn.

                    <br />
                    What now?<br />
                    Well, there are a lot of things you can do. You can take on an ocean monument, pillager raid, or
                    woodland mansion. Or, you could try defeating Minecraft's other boss, the Wither. Expand your base,
                    conquer structures, create redstone contraptions, the possibilities are endless! The game even has
                    an
                    advancement tree that can guide you on your way.
